    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/hint.css/2.4.1/hint.min.css"><br/><!-- toc --><br/><p>At the time I got my first book translation project, I just freshly graduated with my master degree in translation and was doing a job that had nothing to do with translation. The anxiety within me grew every day as I found no passion in doing that job but I had no idea what career I wanted to or could do. Then I came across a crowd-sourcing online platform, operated by an e-book publisher, recruiting “amateurs” to translate non-mainstream books that were less known in their origin country. I registered on the platform, passed the test and got my first book to translate. The platform split each book by chapters and assigned to multiple amateurs for crowd-translating. Amateurs don’t get paid for translating. Nevertheless, once the book gets published, translators can continually receive a percentage of sales for each e-book sold. These royalties-like earnings are not much, though. The point was I found passion and tranquility in book translation, and thus set off as a part-time book translator. </p><p>It has been six years since I submitted my first book translation, the quality of which was, in fact, kinda terrible. A lot of things changed during the six years. I’ve found the career I want to pursue, got a new job and started cooperating with a bigger publishing house, which focuses on print books instead of e-books. Unlike its e-book specialized counterpart mentioned above, this publisher works in a more traditional way. They have higher requirements on translators as they center around academic and popular science books. Now for each book I translate, the publishing house would pay me a certain amount, which is normally depending on how difficult the content is. </p><p>I don’t take translation as the career to pursue, though. There’re a couple of reasons: 1) it would be much less delightful once your hobby becomes your living, 2) you can’t choose which book to translate when it’s your job, 3) essentially it’s a work so tedious that sometimes makes you want to scream, 4) a full-time translator would have to work with tighter deadlines, and 5) you can hardly make a living as the book industry is almost beaten to death by TikTok, Netflix and Steam–at least in the country I’m living in. On the other hand, I have to be grateful to the Internet. Thanks to Google, translating is much easier now. Translation used to be difficult especially when it comes to cultures, as well as specialized terminology and knowledge. Today thousands of millions of people share their culture, experience, knowledge and expertise on the Internet, and you can easily access these valuable resources with a simple click on the “Search” button. The internet saves translators like me from the lack of corpus, references and parallel texts. </p><p>By August 2022, I have translated seven books, and I could still happily feel the passions within me. Hope this post could be updated before long, as I can get one more new book to add.<br><br/></p><h1 id="Published-by-Aug-2022"><a href="#Published-by-Aug-2022" class="headerlink" title="Published (by Aug 2022)"></a>Published (by Aug 2022)</h1><table><thead><tr><th align="center">Cover</th><th>Published in</th><th>Type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><div class="figure center" style="width:230px;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dogandcat/image/upload/v1659453420/%E5%81%87%E8%A1%8C%E5%AE%B6%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97_bmd1mv.png" style="width:230px;height:300px;"alt=""></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></td><td>2021</td><td><a href="https://item.jd.com/13375898.html">Print</a></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><div class="figure center" style="width:200px;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dogandcat/image/upload/v1659515362/Meat_zh_xjxbwd.jpg" style="width:200px;height:300px;"alt=""></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></td><td>2019</td><td><a href="https://e.jd.com/30460638.html">Ebook</a></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><div class="figure center" style="width:200px;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dogandcat/image/upload/v1659515362/Maxwell_s_silver_hammer_zh_wlbbzz.jpg" style="width:200px;height:300px;"alt=""></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></td><td>2018</td><td><a href="https://e.jd.com/30446667.html">Ebook</a></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><div class="figure center" style="width:200px;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dogandcat/image/upload/v1659523382/There_comes_a_time_zh_xwb6cd.jpg" style="width:200px;height:300px;"alt=""></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></td><td>2017</td><td><a href="https://e.jd.com/30355822.html">Ebook</a></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><div class="figure center" style="width:200px;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dogandcat/image/upload/v1659600892/The_quick_guide_to_inversting_in_stock_market_zh_qosxb3.jpg" style="width:200px;height:300px;"alt=""></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></td><td>2017</td><td><a href="https://e.jd.com/30342681.html">Ebook</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><h1 id="Submitted-by-Aug-2022"><a href="#Submitted-by-Aug-2022" class="headerlink" title="Submitted (by Aug 2022)"></a>Submitted (by Aug 2022)</h1><table><thead><tr><th align="center">Cover (the original)</th><th>Translated in</th><th>Type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><div class="figure center" style="width:200px;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dogandcat/image/upload/v1659514448/Genius_Weapon_porgsg.jpg" style="width:200px;height:300px;"alt=""></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></td><td>2021</td><td>Print</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><div class="figure center" style="width:200px;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dogandcat/image/upload/v1659514448/Samurai_Operation_Manual_ztjp5n.jpg" style="width:200px;height:300px;"alt=""></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></td><td>2020</td><td>Print</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><h1 id="All-by-Aug-2022"><a href="#All-by-Aug-2022" class="headerlink" title="All (by Aug 2022)"></a>All (by Aug 2022)</h1><h2 id="Genius-Weapon"><a href="#Genius-Weapon" class="headerlink" title="Genius Weapon"></a>Genius Weapon</h2><p>I picked this book at the first sight when seeing publisher’s books-to-translate list of 2021. I’ve long been into stories about artificial intelligent and robots, such as Blade Runner 2049 and BLAME! (one of my favorite manga series, by Tsutomu Nihei). In brief, the book tries to tell its readers: 1) once we human beings apply AI to weapon and war, our end is doomed; 2) we human have already applied AI to weapons as of the time you are reading the book. </p><br/><table><thead><tr><th><div class="figure left" style="width:200px;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dogandcat/image/upload/v1659514448/Genius_Weapon_porgsg.jpg" style="width:200px;height:300px;"alt=""></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></th><th><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079R5PJFW/">Genius Weapon: Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Weaponry, and the Future of Warfare</a><br/>By Louis A.

The book is written in English and Romanized Japanese, as lots of Japanese terms don’t have counterparts in English, such as “fukigaeshi”, “teppo ko gashira”, “kaishakunin”, etc. When translating these Romanized Japanese terms into Chinese, what I was doing was actually transforming them back to hiragana, then to correct kanji, finally to corresponding Chinese characters, if there’s any. Though these Japanese terms have no cultural counterparts in Chinese neither, Chinese readers have no trouble reading the composed characters. </p><br/><table><thead><tr><th><div class="figure left" style="width:200px;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dogandcat/image/upload/v1659514448/Samurai_Operation_Manual_ztjp5n.jpg" style="width:200px;height:300px;"alt=""></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></th><th><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1785215620/">Samurai Warrior Operation Manual</a><br/> By Chris McNab <br /><br /> Category: Culture &amp; History</th></tr></thead></table><br/><h2 id="Bluffer’s-Guide-To-Wine-print-x2F-published"><a href="#Bluffer’s-Guide-To-Wine-print-x2F-published" class="headerlink" title="Bluffer’s Guide To Wine (print&#x2F;published)"></a>Bluffer’s Guide To Wine (print&#x2F;published)</h2><p>My first step in print book translation. It got me some headache handling the British humour in this book. It’s not only because British’s well-known dry wit is often difficult for non-Brits to understand, but also because we translators are normally required to add footnotes to culture-bound content. The problem is, once you start explaining a joke, the joke is not funny at more. Anyway, I like British jokes, as well as translating them, as it makes my footnotes adding more meaningful. </p><br/><table><thead><tr><th><div class="figure left" style="width:200px;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dogandcat/image/upload/v1659453411/bluffer_s_guide_to_wine_new_pthlxu.png" style="width:200px;height:300px;"alt=""></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></th><th><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1785212419/">Bluffer’s Guide To Wine</a><br />By Jonathan Goodall and Harry Eyres  <br /><br />Category: Culture</th></tr></thead></table><br/><h2 id="Meat-ebook-x2F-published"><a href="#Meat-ebook-x2F-published" class="headerlink" title="Meat (ebook&#x2F;published)"></a>Meat (ebook&#x2F;published)</h2><p>Does the translator also feel scary when translating a horror fiction? The answer is yes. This is the second book I worked with my friend. I took the dual number chapters while she took the singular-numbers. She exchanged two chapters with me because those chapters were too scary and gory to her. Some chapters of the book did got me goose bumps and the standing hairs on both arms–exactly what we want from a horror fiction.</p><br/><table><thead><tr><th><div class="figure left" style="width:200px;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dogandcat/image/upload/v1659523435/Meat_old_nulap1.jpg" style="width:200px;height:300px;"alt="The cover used when I was translating the book, now replaced by a new cover"><span class="caption">The cover used when I was translating the book, now replaced by a new cover</span></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></th><th><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MRGVYT6/">Meat</a> <br/> By Michael Bray  <br /><br /> Category: Horror fiction</th></tr></thead></table><br/><h2 id="Maxwell’s-Silver-Hammer-ebook-x2F-published"><a href="#Maxwell’s-Silver-Hammer-ebook-x2F-published" class="headerlink" title="Maxwell’s Silver Hammer (ebook&#x2F;published)"></a>Maxwell’s Silver Hammer (ebook&#x2F;published)</h2><p>It’s one of those what I call “local novels” that are hard to translate. These novels are appealing to some specific group of readers, while their charm may not come from the story itself, but the “localness”, that is, a mix of local scenes, traditions, people and slangs that you can’t see elsewhere.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/hint.css/2.4.1/hint.min.css"><br/><!-- toc --><br/><p>I was into software product operations for around five years. Product operation is to make the product development process easier for the product team and help build user-friendly products. The company I’m currently working for includes UX writing into the work content of product operation, aligning with user research and user data analysis, so as to efficiently ensure the product is user-friendly. </p><p>It has been three years since I wrote my first UX copy. Yet till recently I’ve retrospected for the first time what I had learnt and experienced in UX writing. No specific guidelines, writing techniques or standards are covered.</p><br/><h1 id="You’re-doing-UX-writing-What-is-that"><a href="#You’re-doing-UX-writing-What-is-that" class="headerlink" title="You’re doing UX writing? What is that?"></a>You’re doing UX writing? What is that?</h1><p>UX writing is to write texts in the user interface of a software product (e.g. an app or a website). This can include the title bar texts, page titles, descriptions, notifications, tooltips, error messages, and even control labels. </p><p>The task of UX writing is to guide users through this software with crafted words. My ultimate (sometimes impossible) mission is to make the software easy to use.</p><br/><h1 id="UX-writing-or-copywriting"><a href="#UX-writing-or-copywriting" class="headerlink" title="UX writing or copywriting?"></a>UX writing or copywriting?</h1><p>Broadly speaking, UX writing is indeed a kind of copywriting. Essentially they are both about crafting words and conveying certain messages to readers. The major difference, at least from my personal experience, is that you have fewer chances to write long sentences when doing UX writing, and the chances get even fewer when it comes to paragraphs. Compared to copywriting, UX writing has less to do with writing.</p><br/><h1 id="Doing-UX-writing-is-easy-and-hard"><a href="#Doing-UX-writing-is-easy-and-hard" class="headerlink" title="Doing UX writing is easy and hard"></a>Doing UX writing is easy and hard</h1><p>Thanks to the internet, I can easily find many blog articles talking about UX writing, and some of them are very good. These articles not only provide us a comprehensive view of UX writing, but also specific guidelines, good examples, and best practices. Living in a digital era, we’re standing on the shoulders of UX writers all over the world. </p><p>I’ve written copy for several web applications and two mobile applications. Below are some practices that I found work very well in my UX writing. </p><br/><h2 id="Be-consistent"><a href="#Be-consistent" class="headerlink" title="Be consistent"></a>Be consistent</h2><p>Never use different words to refer to the same feature. Inconsistency creates confusion. This confusion could even create a ripple effect especially when your application offers multiple languages. You’d never want to experience that.</p><h2 id="Be-concise-and-clear"><a href="#Be-concise-and-clear" class="headerlink" title="Be concise and clear"></a>Be concise and clear</h2><p>Remember that users are using an application, not reading an article. Normally they won’t spare their attention to any texts unless they’re doing some configuration or encountering an error. After all, the digital space might be infinite, but the size of our phone&#x2F;computer screen is not. </p><p>   <strong>Keep it concise</strong></p><img src="/Whats%20UX%20Writing/yes_no-submit-the-change.png" class="noncaption left clear"><br/><p>  <strong>Avoid ambiguity</strong></p><img src="/Whats%20UX%20Writing/yes_no-cancel-the-order.png" class="noncaption left clear"><h2 id="Be-plain-and-simple"><a href="#Be-plain-and-simple" class="headerlink" title="Be plain and simple"></a>Be plain and simple</h2><p>Use jargon only when necessary. Use plain and simple words. Focus on what users can do, what this can do for them, and what they need to do. It’s guiding users through an application, but not giving them a math or coding class. </p><br/><p>Though UX copy appears simple on the surface, doing UX writing is not that simple. As some senior UX writers , it requires the knowledge of design principles, technical skills, and a deep understanding of your product and of user needs. However, if you ask me what’s the most challenging in UX writing, I’d say the cross-functional collaboration. And there’re always a lot.</p><br/><h1 id="Collaboration-No-it’s-compromise"><a href="#Collaboration-No-it’s-compromise" class="headerlink" title="Collaboration? No, it’s compromise"></a>Collaboration? No, it’s compromise</h1><p>When doing UX writing, probably I just need to spend around 30% of my time writing words. 50% is spent collaborating with developers, UI designer and product manager. </p><p>Developers often think of texts as something only to explain what they have developed. The problem is, UX writing is NOT technical writing. Technical writing is writing for systems, which focuses on what systems <em>can</em> and <em>cannot</em> do, while UX writing is writing for users, which is about <em>what systems can do for them</em> and what value the system will bring them. </p><p>UI designers <em>hate</em> long sentences, as which “degrade” their design. They believe illustrations speak louder than words and a good graphical interface is clear enough to guide users through the product. </p><p>As for product manager, sometimes they believe (from nowhere) there’s an invisible bond existing between them and users, with which they need no word to understand each other. Hence, textual explanations are not that necessary, but more like the strawberries on the cake. </p><br/><p>What’s about the rest 20%? I hear you’re asking. The rest 20% is normally reserved for my legal and marketing colleagues. They’ll look into the copy, and, if needed, give their advice as well. As they don’t involve in the development process, usually we’ll prepare a demo for them. This way, they can better understand how our new feature&#x2F;application works and interacts with users. </p><p>Simply put, for my years in UX writing, I’ve learnt more about negotiating, presenting, and perspective transformation than writing. </p><br/><h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>UX writing can be identified as the following:</p><p>- <strong>What to write:</strong> software texts that could be seen by users, including the title bar text, page titles, descriptions, notifications, tooltips, error messages, and even control labels.</p><p>- <strong>Purpose to write:</strong> use crafted words to guide users of different educational or cultural backgrounds throughout your software product with ease.</p><br/><p>I like doing UX writing, and it hardly makes me feel bored. A software can be seen as composed of codes, graphical interfaces and texts. Codes make up its bones and organs, and graphical interfaces serve as its appearance, while texts form up its voice to speak with human users. Via UX writing, a software is enabled to “speak” in a more human way.</p><p>Users are not likely to perceive a bug, but they can always notice a typo. As <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/uxguide/text-ui#design-concepts">Microsoft UX Guide states</a>，</p><blockquote><p><em>…This text is, after all, seen more frequently and by more people than perhaps any other type of technical writing.</em></p></blockquote><br/>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/hint.css/2.4.1/hint.min.css"><BR/><p>本篇不涉及写作技巧或标准，只说说概念性的东西。</p><!-- toc --><BR/><h1 id="什么是用户体验文案（UX-Writer）？"><a href="#什么是用户体验文案（UX-Writer）？" class="headerlink" title="什么是用户体验文案（UX Writer）？"></a>什么是用户体验文案（UX Writer）？</h1><p>指负责撰写软件产品UI界面文本的人，任务是让用户可以正确理解并操作该软件。</p><p>简单来说，这个倒霉蛋负责撰写软件中一切用户会看到的文本，包括标题栏文本、页面标题、说明、通知、提示、错误消息乃至控件标签。</p><BR/><h1 id="为什么不叫文案？"><a href="#为什么不叫文案？" class="headerlink" title="为什么不叫文案？"></a>为什么不叫文案？</h1><p>……可以，怎么叫都可以。广义上讲，UX writer的确是文案的一种。我在一些项目里担任UX writer，我的同事也叫我文案，讲究一点地叫我“英文文案”，因为我只负责写英文。 </p><p>简而言之，文案有很多种，比如游戏文案和广告文案（即copywriter），UX writer是其中的一个细分分支。</p><br/><h1 id="为何要单独设立一个UX-writer？"><a href="#为何要单独设立一个UX-writer？" class="headerlink" title="为何要单独设立一个UX writer？"></a>为何要单独设立一个UX writer？</h1><p>往大里说，现代社会分工细嘛；往小里说，这算是互联网走入千家万户，市场成熟和开放所带来的结果，由于用户的选择非常多，多数情况下他们不想花费时间学习如何使用&#x2F;操作一款软件，他们的注意力往往非常短暂，因此开发者不得不让自己家软件的使用流程变得尽可能简单。</p><p>要实现这一点，一般依托于界面设计（即UI）和配合的说明文字之上。可以参考微软的阐述：</p><br/><blockquote><p>软件开发者对文本的理解通常只限于产品文档和技术支持：“首先我们把代码写出来，然后雇个人帮我们解释说明下我们开发的东西。”然而在现实中，重要的文本在流程早期就要写下，这样才好敲定并开发用户界面（UI）——毕竟这个文本的阅读次数和阅读人数可能远多于其他任何一类技术文档。</p><p><em>Software developers often think of text as relegated to product documentation and technical support. “First we’ll write the code, and then we’ll hire someone to help us explain what we have developed.” Yet in reality, important text is written earlier in the process, as the UI is conceived and coded. This text is, after all, seen more frequently and by more people than perhaps any other type of technical writing.</em></p></blockquote><br/><p>对于一款软件来说， UI和界面文案是一般用户最能直观感受，同时也是接触最多的东西。打一个比方：就像盖一间房子，技术是这栋房子的墙体结构，而UI是这栋房子的室内硬装，文案则是好比家具和窗帘布艺之类的软装。在房子结构大抵相似的时候，室内装修就成了用户的首要筛选标准——毕竟一般来说装修越豪华，住起来就越舒服。</p><p>因此，要问为何会诞生UX writer这种分工，一言以蔽之：软件公司想要赚更多钱。</p><br/><h1 id="写界面文案一定需要UX-writer吗？"><a href="#写界面文案一定需要UX-writer吗？" class="headerlink" title="写界面文案一定需要UX writer吗？"></a>写界面文案一定需要UX writer吗？</h1><p>就像装修也可以DIY那样，答案是可以不需要UX writer，你自己亲自撸袖子提笔上也不是不行。</p><br/><p>这个工作说简单也简单，但说难也确实很难。撰写界面文案如同撰写简历，共通点是希冀借由文字这个媒介，在有限的空间和扫一眼的时间内将自身优点100%甚至120%地全面展现出来。根据我的经验，在已经具备坚实的墙体结构和靓丽硬装的基础上，再来一份引导清晰且友好的界面文案能轻易实现1+1+1 &gt; 3的效果。</p><p>正如人人都是产品经理那样，人人都可以是UX writer。那么，这就引出了我们的下一个主题——</p><br/><h1 id="在写界面文案时需要注意什么？"><a href="#在写界面文案时需要注意什么？" class="headerlink" title="在写界面文案时需要注意什么？"></a>在写界面文案时需要注意什么？</h1><p>汇总一下，撰写界面文案这个工作的基本要素如下：</p><br/><ul><li><strong>要写的内容是：</strong> 软件中一切用户会看到的文本，包括标题栏文本、页面标题、说明、通知、提示、错误消息乃至控件标签。</li><li><strong>写作目的是：</strong> 对不同教育或文化背景的用户都友好，通过有效引导和说明让用户轻松惬意地使用你的软件。</li><li><strong>这一切的前提：</strong> 理解你的产品，了解你的用户群体。</li></ul><br/><p>而<span class="highlight-text orange">影响界面文案质量的因素则包括书写人的语言水平和写作技巧，以及公司采用的文本标准 </span>。其中前二者因人而异，取决于你自身的教育背景和后天积累，而文本标准则因公司而异，比如大公司一般要求采用正式用词，禁止使用任何俚语，一般要求保持中性语气，而小团队则通常更加自由，允许采用非正式词汇，风格也可以更随意，更具感情色彩。</p><p>但就像开头已经说过的，本文不涉及具体的写作技巧或标准，只会讲讲概念性的东西。因此，根据我自己在界面文案撰写上的过往经验，我总结了个人认为算是普遍适用性质的三个跟书写语言是中文还是英文或是采用了何种文本标准无关的<strong>通用要点</strong>，分别是：</p><ol><li>保持一致</li><li>简短有力且无歧义</li><li>用户视角</li></ol><br/><p>下面逐个详细说明。</p><h2 id="保持一致"><a href="#保持一致" class="headerlink" title="保持一致"></a>保持一致</h2><p>保证在所有提及某个功能&#x2F;页面&#x2F;按钮的地方，该功能&#x2F;页面&#x2F;按钮都叫同一个名字。</p><br/><p>举个例子，你设计了一个功能叫做“购物车”，那么在软件中其他地方不要称呼这个功能为“购物篮”。类似的例子还有，不要在一个页面上写“点击此处<em>结算</em>”，页面说明中却写的是“<em>结账</em>时请注意”。</p><p>这种不一致的体验就仿佛是喊张三丰回头的却是张三那样，<strong>你的用户在短暂的混乱和困惑后可能会马上反应过来，但原本流畅的使用体验被打断</strong>。而且，这种乍看之下很小的问题如果坐视不理，混乱很可能将成倍放大，比如决定翻译为其他语言的时候。</p><br/><h2 id="简短有力且无歧义"><a href="#简短有力且无歧义" class="headerlink" title="简短有力且无歧义"></a>简短有力且无歧义</h2><p>一来UI中给文本留下的空间本就有限，二来写多了根本没人会看，因此要做到语言简练，传达重点。从下面两个层面着手：</p><br/><ul><li><strong>层面一：尽量简短，但每个词都有意义</strong></li></ul><p>按写作目的区分，界面文本可大致归为三类：说明、引导和解释（比如错误提示）。 <strong>核心宗旨是单刀直入，直指重点，言简意赅。</strong></p><br/><p>举几个具体的例子：</p><p>🌰 在写说明时不要跑偏去解释显而易见的东西，而是聚焦于“功能说明”这个重点。比如</p><p>❌ 跑偏了</p><p>✅ 聚焦于说明</p><br/>🌰 解释一个问题/错误（error）时，不要提及与用户体验无关的技术详情。<p>🌰 引导指向明确，比如首选特定标签而不是泛型标签。比如最常见的做法是用具体指示替换万能的Yes：</p><br/><ul><li><strong>层面二：尽量简短，同时避免歧义</strong></li></ul><p>在保证语言简洁的同时，一定要检查下文字是否会产生歧义。比如下面这个我遇到的经典案例：</p><p>❌  乍一看去谁都要懵一下</p><p>✅  好不少</p><br/><h2 id="用户视角"><a href="#用户视角" class="headerlink" title="用户视角"></a>用户视角</h2><p>尝试从用户的视角去构思文本，然后同样从用户的视角去审视自己撰写完的文本。</p><br/><p>这一点是最微妙也是最难掌握的，<span class="highlight-text orange">你知道的不代表用户知道，你理解的不等于用户理解 </span> 。对用户的了解需要时间的积累，而转换视角的能力要么源于天赋，要么需要接受后天训练。</p><p>举个最简单的例子：</p><p>🌰 在挑选用词时可以问问自己：<strong>我的用户是专业人士还是普罗大众？</strong></p><p>以 “abort”一词为例，在编程中该词通常意为“（进程）终止”或“（进程）中断”，但对于没有计算机背景的人而言，这个词的含义是“人工流产”或“堕胎”。</p><br/><h1 id="无人在意的结束语"><a href="#无人在意的结束语" class="headerlink" title="无人在意的结束语"></a>无人在意的结束语</h1><p>界面文案通常是开发流程中比较细枝末节的部分，且它对于用户体验的影响时刻处于一种薛定谔状态：</p><ul><li>用户可能不会发现软件的bug，但一定会发现文案里出现的任何一个错字&#x2F;语法错误；</li><li>用户没有耐心阅读超过两行的文字，同时会抱怨文案写得太短没讲清楚。</li></ul><p>倘若界面文案无功无过，此时它的存在仿佛空气，但一旦误导了用户，有时可带来山崩般的效果。一说起要提升用户体验，大部分人更习惯从功能和UI着眼实施优化，屡屡忽视界面文案，然而很多时候这却是最快且最易行的提升——有的时候，不是功能设计得不好，也不是UI不够简洁，只不过是你的用户没读懂你的界面引导而已。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/hint.css/2.4.1/hint.min.css"><p>本文简介：翻译一下来自300年前的两篇日记</p><br/><blockquote><p>SEPTEMBER 1665</p></blockquote><p>1665年9月</p> <br/><blockquote><p>2nd. This morning I wrote letters to Mr. Hill and Andrews to come to dine with me to-morrow, and then I to the office, where busy, and thence to dine with Sir J. Minnes, where merry, but only that Sir J. Minnes who hath lately lost two coach horses, dead in the stable, has a third now a dying. </p></blockquote><p>2日。早上给希尔先生和安德鲁家写了信，邀请他们明天同我共进晚餐，然后便出门去了办公室，在那儿忙活了一天，之后直接赶赴J.明尼斯爵士的晚餐之约，这顿饭很是愉快，只是明尼斯爵士最近刚失去了两匹挽马，都死在了马厩里，另有一匹如今也只剩下一口气。</p><br/><blockquote><p>After dinner I to Deptford, and there took occasion to ‘entrar a la casa de la gunaica de ma Minusier’, and did what I had a mind… To Greenwich, where wrote some letters, and home in pretty good time.</p></blockquote><p>晚饭后去了德特福德，乘机 “入了我子匠馁仁的幕” ，实现了我的念想……这之后去了格林威治，在那儿写了大几封信，很晚才到家。</p><div class="alert info"><p>此句的原文为“entrar a la casa de la gunaica de ma Minusier”。直译意为“进入了我木匠夫人的房子”。<br><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"><span class="hint--top hint--error hint--medium hint--rounded hint--bounce" aria-label="[来源](https://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/02/)">[1]</span></a></sup>“Gunaica” 为希腊语词汇 γυναικα 的英语转写写法，意为“女士；Minusier为法语词汇 menuisier 的英语转写写法，意为“木匠”，entrar a la casa de…则为西班牙语，意为 “进入了（某人）的房子”。<br>原文谜语人，因此译文尽量保持谜语人：“子匠”实为“梓匠”，是古时对木匠的称呼，“馁仁”实为“内人”，即“妻子”的文雅说法，此处为使用同音字来表现原文的英语转写手法；而“入了……的幕”即为“入幕之宾”的化用。</p></div><br/><blockquote><p>3rd (Lord’s day). Up; and put on my coloured silk suit very fine, and my new periwigg, bought a good while since, but cnot wear, because the plague was in Westminster when I bought it; and it is a wonder what will be the fashion after the plague is done, as to periwiggs, for nobody will dare to buy any haire, for fear of the infection, that it had been cut off of the heads of people dead of the plague.</p></blockquote><p>3日（礼拜日）。起床，套上我的彩染丝绸礼服，戴上我新买的假发，虽说买了好一段时间了，但一直都没敢戴，因为买的时候威斯敏斯特正爆发疫情；而且假发这个东西，难说瘟疫过去后潮流会变成什么样子，可能到时候没人再敢买，因为害怕被传染，那头发说不准是从死于瘟疫的人的头上剪下来的。</p> <br/><blockquote><p>Before church time comes Mr. Hill (Mr. Andrews failing because he was to receive the Sacrament), and to church, where a sorry dull parson, and so home and most excellent company with Mr. Hill and discourse of musique. I took my Lady Pen home, and her daughter Pegg, and merry we were; and after dinner I made my wife show them her pictures, which did mad Pegg Pen, who learns of the same man and cannot do so well. After dinner left them and I by water to Greenwich, where much ado to be suffered to come into the towne because of the sicknesse, for fear I should come from London, till I told them who I was.</p></blockquote><p>礼拜开始前碰到了希尔先生（没看见安德鲁斯先生，因为他去受领圣餐了），去做礼拜，这儿的牧师沉闷得让人受不了，做完便回了家，最高兴的是有希尔先生为伴，和他聊音乐聊得相当尽兴。我将佩恩女爵夫人和她女儿佩吉带来家中作客，我们相当愉快。晚饭后，我让妻子给她们展示一下她的画作，结果却让佩吉·佩恩气恼不已，她也在一个老师门下学画，水平却差得远。晚饭后我送她们回家，然后走水路去了格林威治，因为瘟疫，耽搁了很久也没放我进城，害怕我是从伦敦来的，直到我跟他们说了我的身份。</p> <br/><blockquote><p>So up to the church, where at the door I find Captain Cocke in my Lord Brunker’s coach, and he come out and walked with me in the church-yarde till the church was done, talking of the ill government of our Kingdom, nobody setting to heart the business of the Kingdom, but every body minding their particular profit or pleasures, the King himself minding nothing but his ease, and so we let things go to wracke. </p></blockquote><p>终于上到教堂，刚到大门口，正看见库克上尉在布伦克尔勋爵的马车上，于是他下了车跟我在教堂院子里散步到礼拜结束，边走边谈论我们大英帝国那糟糕的政府，没人真心关心这个国家的事，人人都只在乎自己那点利益或享乐，连国王陛下本人都只顾他自己逍遥，所以我们也就任由一切烂下去。</p><br/><blockquote><p>This arose upon considering what we shall do for money when the fleete comes in, and more if the fleete should not meet with the Dutch, which will put a disgrace upon the King’s actions, so as the Parliament and Kingdom will have the less mind to give more money, besides so bad an account of the last money, we fear, will be given, not half of it being spent, as it ought to be, upon the Navy. </p></blockquote><p>说到这我们考虑起等舰队搞起来了应该怎么做才能要到钱，而且还要想点办法让舰队别遇上荷兰人，否则必会让国王陛下脸面尽失，这样一来议会和国家以后都不会有什么心思给钱了，我们担心最后一笔钱的账目将一塌糊涂，本来该有一半花在海军上，到时候一半都没有。</p><br/><blockquote><p>Besides, it is said that at this day our Lord Treasurer cannot tell what the profit of Chimney money is, what it comes to per annum, nor looks whether that or any other part of the revenue be duly gathered as it ought; the very money that should pay the City the L200,000 they lent the King, being all gathered and in the hands of the Receiver and hath been long and yet not brought up to pay the City, whereas we are coming to borrow 4 or L500,000 more of the City, which will never be lent as is to be feared.</p></blockquote><p>另外，据说如今财务大臣阁下说不出烟囱税的利润是多少，每年收了多少，也也不知道这部分或其他任何部分的收入是否按规定收了。他们把本该支付给本市的20万英镑借给了国王，这笔钱已经全部收集完毕，在接管人手中，但一直没拿出来付给本市，反之我们却要向本市再借40到50万英镑，而这钱恐怕是永远也借不出来了。</p><br/><blockquote><p>Church being done, my Lord Bruncker, Sir J. Minnes, and I up to the Vestry at the desire of the justices of the Peace, Sir Theo. Biddulph and Sir W. Boreman and Alderman Hooker, in order to the doing something for the keeping of the plague from growing; but Lord! to consider the madness of the people of the town, who will (because they are forbid) come in crowds along with the dead corps to see them buried; but we agreed on some orders for the prevention thereof.</p></blockquote><p>礼拜结束后，布伦克尔勋爵、J.明尼斯爵士和我应治安官西奥·比达尔夫爵士和W.铂尔曼爵士以及胡克议员之邀，前往祭衣聖器儲藏室商讨可为阻止瘟疫的蔓延做些什么。但主啊！想想镇民们有多疯，他们偏要（因为他们被禁止这样做）成群结队地围在死者身边看他们下葬，不过我们还是就颁布一些预防瘟疫的命令达成了一致。</p> <br/><blockquote><p>Among other stories, one was very passionate, methought, of a complaint brought against a man in the towne for taking a child from London from an infected house. Alderman Hooker told us it was the child of a very able citizen in Gracious Street, a saddler, who had buried all the rest of his children of the plague, and himself and wife now being shut up and in despair of escaping, did desire only to save the life of this little child; and so prevailed to have it received stark-naked into the arms of a friend, who brought it (having put it into new fresh clothes) to Greenwich; where upon hearing the story, we did agree it should be permitted to be received and kept in the towne.</p></blockquote><p>有个故事相对于其他的来说非常激动人心——至少我觉得是——城里有个人被指控从伦敦某栋有疫情的房子里带出了一个孩子。胡克议员告诉我们，那孩子是如意街一个非常能干的市民的，那人是个马鞍匠，家里其他几个孩子因为瘟疫都没了，而他和妻子如今被关在房子中，已断了逃跑的念头，唯独只想挽救幼子的性命，因此他说服了一个朋友，把赤条条的孩子递到他怀里，之后这位朋友将孩子（换上干净的新衣服）带到了格林威治。听完这个故事后，我们一致同意应该允许接收这个孩子并让他留在城里。</p> <br/><blockquote><p>Thence with my Lord Bruncker to Captain Cocke’s, where we mighty merry and supped, and very late I by water to Woolwich, in great apprehensions of an ague. Here was my Lord Bruncker’s lady of pleasure, who, I perceive, goes every where with him; and he, I find, is obliged to carry her, and make all the courtship to her that can be.</p></blockquote><p>在这之后，我和布伦克尔勋爵去了库克上尉家，我们相谈甚欢并共进了晚饭，走水路去伍利奇时已经很晚了，我十分担忧自己会得疟疾。这里要说说布伦克尔勋爵的女伴，我知道她到哪里都和他一起，现在我发现是他非要带着她，而且总是换着花样地向她示爱。</p><br/><p><br/><div id="footnotes"><hr><div id="footnotelist"><ol style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0; margin-left: 40px"><li id="fn:1"><span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; padding-right: 10px; margin-left: -40px">1.</span><span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; margin-left: 10px;"><a href="https://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/02/">来源</a><a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></span></li></ol></div></div></p>]]></content>
